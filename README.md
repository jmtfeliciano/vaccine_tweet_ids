# vaccine_tweet_ids
I am in the process of regularly collecting vaccine-related English tweets from Twitter.  More details will be released later.  

To comply with Twitterâ€™s Terms of Service, I can only release Tweet IDs which should help researchers with a Twitter Developer Account. You agree to noncommercial use of the data I will post here.

The process of getting tweets from tweet ids is called hydration. You may use tools such as Hydrator and Twarc to get these data. 

For any question, you may email me at dev@jfeliciano.io
